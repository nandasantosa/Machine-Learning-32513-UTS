The data that we are using is available on Kaggle and it was drawn from the Bureau of Meteorology Australia 2010. It contains daily observation of Australian weather from different weather station and there are 24 different attributes.  The rainfall observation occured in various locations throughout Australia in the last 10 years - 2008 to 2018. Australia is a land of extreme weather especially dryness. Based on Geoscience Australia, the extreme changes in a day have happened frequently in different regions of Australia. This practical machine learning project demonstrates the usage of trained model to predict whether it rained the next day or not which we set it as the target variable; RainTomorow."
